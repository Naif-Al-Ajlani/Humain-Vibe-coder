# Lovable Integration Prompts

## Component Generation
**Goal:** Generate a new React component using Lovable's design system.

**Prompt:**
"Generate a new React component named `[ComponentName]` that uses the Lovable design system. The component should have the following props: `[props]`. It should render `[description of what it renders]`. The output should be a single `.jsx` file."

## Style Generation
**Goal:** Generate CSS for a component using Lovable's design tokens.

**Prompt:**
"Generate CSS for the `[ComponentName]` component using Lovable's design tokens. The CSS should be in a separate `.css` file and should be imported into the component. The styles should be scoped to the component to avoid conflicts."

## Lovable API Integration
**Goal:** Integrate a component with one of Lovable's APIs.

**Prompt:**
"Integrate the `[ComponentName]` component with the `[LovableApiName]` API. The component should call the `[methodName]` method when `[triggering event]` occurs. The response from the API should be used to `[description of what to do with the response]`."
