Artificial Intelligence Engineer · HUMAIN
Job Title: Vibe Coder Location: Riyadh Company: HUMAIN Team: AI Engineering / Creative Automation

About HUMAIN
HUMAIN is building the future of AI-native enterprise platforms – where software writes itself, agents replace apps, and work feels more human. From code to creativity, we empower teams to build, automate, and scale using the full potential of generative AI.

The Role
We’re hiring a Vibe Coder – a new kind of developer who codes with AI, not just alongside it. You’ll use AI tools like Copilot, GPT-4, Replit Ghostwriter, and custom internal agents to build high-impact experiences, interfaces, and automations across our AI-first platform. Your superpower isn’t just writing great code – it’s knowing how to prompt, guide, and orchestrate AI to code at scale and speed.
You’ll prototype, automate, and ship fast – often starting with a prompt instead of a blank file. You’ll design tools that feel alive. And you’ll shape how users, teams, and agents interact inside HUMAIN’s ecosystem.

Key Responsibilities
* Use AI coding tools (e.g. GPT-4, Replit, Cody, Code Interpreter) to rapidly prototype, build, and refine features
* Co-author code with AI to build intelligent workflows, internal tools, and dynamic interfaces
* Design prompt strategies and automation chains that transform user intent into working software
* Collaborate with product, design, and platform teams to ship high-velocity features that are usable, intuitive, and fast
* Build reusable agents and workflows that accelerate other developers across HUMAIN
* Continuously push the boundaries of AI-assisted coding – speed, scale, emotion, and elegance

What You Bring
* Strong developer mindset with fluency in modern web stacks (React, TypeScript, Node.js, Python, etc.)
* Deep experience using AI coding tools in real-world projects – not just as assistants, but as core development tools
* Ability to write great prompts, debug with LLMs, and guide AI to generate and refactor code
* Product sense: you care about UX, velocity, and clarity, not just syntax
* Bonus: experience building internal tools, dev platforms, or no-code/low-code systems
* Bonus: understanding of agent architecture, LangChain, or orchestration frameworks

Why It Matters
HUMAIN is redefining how software gets built – with agents, not apps. As a Vibe Coder, you’ll shape the developer experience of the future. You’ll be part of a generation that codes at 10x speed, with 10x reach, powered by AI.
This is not just about writing code. It’s about designing the new language of creation.
How to Apply
Show us how you build with AI. Submit a link to a repo, a demo, or even a prompt that blew your mind. If it vibes, we’ll talk.

# Answers for the LLM to enhance his accuracy:
