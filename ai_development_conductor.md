### 🎯 Key Features That Align with HUMAIN's Vision
1.  **Prompt-Driven Development**
    ```javascript
    // Example: User input -> Working application
    const projectRequest = "Build a todo app with AI-powered task categorization";
    const generatedApp = await aiConductor.orchestrate(projectRequest);
    ```
2.  **AI Code Co-Authoring**
    - Show real-time collaboration between human intent and AI execution
    - Document the prompt strategies used for each component
    - Display AI decision-making process transparently
3.  **Workflow Intelligence**
    - n8n workflows that adapt based on project complexity
    - AI agents that communicate and coordinate automatically
    - Self-improving prompt templates
4.  **Meta-Development**
    - The platform builds itself using its own capabilities
    - Continuous AI-assisted feature additions
    - Self-documenting code generation
